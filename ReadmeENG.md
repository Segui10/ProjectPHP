# ProjectPHP
This is the result of the PHP project by Sergio Martinez 1 DAW.
The project is divided in a series of exercises where you have acquired the necessary requirements to make a first MVC project of a web, with PHP, MySql, JS, HTML5 and CSS3.
The final project called "WebDesignPHPMySql" consists of an MVC structure with PHP.

# Web structure

The structure consists of a header, a menu and a static footer where they are passed to the following pages and remain the same
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_5z1MQOGXYg/WTW-fK5KtkI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/kyMDGea-Pw8DIZvOyZQwJdVPCRHLj5D4wCJoC/w530-h279-p-rw/Captura.png" width = "350px" />
</p>
The dynamic part of the web is the content where from the menu you can navigate to the different pages.

# Start

</ p>

In the home page we have a slider made with JS where three images of different brands

# User

</p>

In the user page we can find a list in which all the mobiles that are in the database are found, from a controller we will get the list that we want.
On the page you will find a series of filters:


+ Favorites filter, where you can see all the mobiles you have in your favorites section
+ Device filter, where you can sort all devices for the operating system, and the best option is uqe take out all the devices
+ Finally, filter the evaluation of the Antutu web and filter to sort by the size of the screen.

</p>
In this view we can see some of the fields to insert a mobil, it is a simple form with botton to submit, the css is totally personalized, most of the forms are used as:

Radiobutton, Select / option, inputs, textview, and a datepicker

# Update

</p>
The update section is completely the same, but instead of having to enter all the data, the data is already filled.

# Read
<p align="center">

</p>

The read page is the most complete since it includes all the data of the mobile.

+ Tabien the section of buttons where you can go back, do an update and delete the phone
